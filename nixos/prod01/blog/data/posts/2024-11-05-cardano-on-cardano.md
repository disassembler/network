## Cardano on Cardano

Have you ever wanted to run your own Cardano mainnet blockchain?
Do you want faster slot times and zero height battles? Do you want
larger block and transaction sizes at the risk of slower validation?

Well, this proposal is for you. Cardano on Cardano brings the power of
the Cardano UTxO model, native assets, simple native scripts, plutus scripts
and even the full Cardano governance layer to your blockchain! You can tailor
the governance model to be managed by a small committee of your choosing, like
the bootstrap CIP-1694 model, or full blown governance with drep participation!

You get all the power of the hard fork combinator for future upgrades for free,
and because of the superb modularity of the cardano code base itself, you can take
advantage of new features coming to Cardano such as utxo-hd as they're rolled out!

How's it work? IOG started developing a partner chains framework in 2021.
This framework allows SPOs to submit contracts on mainnet to use the power
of their secured stake as a BFT consensus node on your custom network.

They initially used substrate for a quick prototyping experience, but now it's
matured to be able to utilize Cardano and the wealth of research papers it's
built on as well! That means you can launch your own Cardano with a different
tokenomics policy, incentives, governance rules, fixed and modifiable
parameters for your own chain!

Because of open source, as Cardano evolves to have more features, you can
continuously update your chain to take advantage of them, or not, the choice
is up to you!!!

partner chains SDK

## Customer Testimonials

"I always wanted to build a business that could replace credit card payments
for farmers markets. The limitations of Cardano mainnet were too much for me
to do it, but thanks to Cardano on Cardano, I was able to make blocks in the
megabytes and process smart contracts for seconds. This would completely violate
the security of Cardano itself, but I was able to set the parameters myself
to be able do this safely with a handful of SPOs using the Partner Chains SDK.
If it weren't for Cardano on Cardano, my business never would have started!"

"My last crypto business was a flop because I launched it on ethereum. A bug
in the ERC20 token allowed my entire customer base to lose everything. They
tried to sue me, but they couldn't find anywhere with jurisdiction. I did a
lot of research, and found Cardano on Cardano. Now I can have native assets
where the holders are the only ones that can touch the token and I don't have
to be accountable. Our volume was too large to use Cardano, but Cardano on
Cardano allowed us to have only our transactions in blocks on a chain SPOs
on Cardano sign up to make blocks for coupon rewards. Than you Cardano on Cardano!"
